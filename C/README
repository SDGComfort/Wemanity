This is a first pass refactoring. As such the aim was to simplify the structure.

There are a bunch of improvements that could be made both to the unit test code
as well as the actual code.

1) Wrap the ITEM structure in another structure and construct a linked list.
2) This would then allow the dynamic addition of stock items.
3) Structure would also contain a Type field that would be computed once when items are added. This
   would get rid of the bulk of the strcmp functions.
4) Wrap the test code in an "ifdef TEST" macro
5) Extend the addition of items to allow items that don't fall into the current types to be added.
6) Refactor the very repetitive unit tests to run in loops and not use magiv numbers

Note. As is, the text tests will not run correctly since the array size was set to 5. Increase this to 8 or greater if you want to run the text tests.
